# Senka Monitor for KC3Kai

A plugin to monitor the senka (rank points) of player on a daily basis and to help rankers who use KC3Kai plan their action.

## Features

    - [x] Track rank points on a daily basis for player;
    - [x] Automatically cutoff (daily and monthly);
    - [ ] Track change trend of rank points of 6th, 21st, 101st, 501st
          players;
    - [ ] Set a goal and plan the future rank points you need to gather;

Due to the limitation of original KC3Kai on development, it is hard to test
the plugin in its framework. Therefore, I created this repository to
develop the core part of senka monitor.
